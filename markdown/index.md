# Vectors for Data Science

**A Beginner's Guide to Vector Math for Machine Learning**

*Learn through your online store — from basic math to predictions*

---

## What You'll Learn

This 10-lesson course teaches you **vector operations** — the mathematical foundation of machine learning — using simple, real-world examples from running an online store.

No prior math background needed. We start from scratch and build up to making actual predictions about customer behavior.

> 📊 **Our Learning Approach**
> 
> Every concept uses the same example: **"Cozy Corner Shop"** — your small online store selling candles and home goods. You'll learn to predict which customers will buy after receiving a promotional email.

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **By the end of this course, you will:**

- Understand what vectors are and why they matter in data science
- Perform all essential vector operations (addition, subtraction, dot product, etc.)
- Know how these operations power machine learning models
- Write Python code using NumPy to work with vectors
- Build a simple prediction model from scratch

## Course Lessons

| # | Lesson | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 0 | [What Is a Vector?](what-is-a-vector.md) | Understand vectors as ordered lists representing customer data |
| 1 | [Vector Addition](vector-addition.md) | Combine profiles and find group averages (centroids) |
| 2 | [Vector Subtraction](vector-subtraction.md) | Measure differences and track changes over time |
| 3 | [Scalar Multiplication](scalar-multiplication.md) | Scale features and adjust importance |
| 4 | [Dot Product](dot-product.md) ⭐ | **Most important!** Calculate prediction scores |
| 5 | [Cross Product](cross-product.md) | Find perpendicular directions (3D geometry) |
| 6 | [Line Equation](line-equation.md) | Model trends; understand gradient descent |
| 7 | [Plane Equation](plane-equation.md) | Create decision boundaries separating groups |
| 8 | [Line Intersections](line-intersections.md) | Find points satisfying multiple trends |
| 9 | [Plane Intersections](plane-intersections.md) | Solve systems; constrained optimization |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to know calculus for this course?

No! We focus on linear algebra concepts that don't require calculus. The most complex operation is multiplication and addition.

### Q: What is a "feature vector" and why does it matter?

A feature vector is simply a list of numbers describing one item (like a customer). It matters because ALL machine learning models take feature vectors as input. Understanding vectors = understanding how ML works.

### Q: What's the difference between "conversion" and "churn"?

**Conversion** = when someone does what you wanted (like buying after an email). **Churn** = when someone leaves (stops buying, cancels subscription). Both are outcomes we predict using vectors!

### Q: Which lesson is most important for machine learning?

Lesson 4: Dot Product is the foundation of almost every ML prediction. If you only have time for one lesson, make it that one!

### Q: Can I skip the cross product lesson?

Yes, if you're only interested in tabular/spreadsheet data. Cross products are mainly used in 3D graphics and robotics, not typical customer analytics.
